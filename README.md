# Project SCV

The Smart Conveyance Vehicle is an attempt to create an autonomous robot that uses sensors to interact with its environment and perform the following tasks 
i.e. 

(1) to follow a chosen track, 

(2) look for obstacles along the path, 

(3) choose an alternative path, 

(4) reach the destination and

(5) follow back to the source.
